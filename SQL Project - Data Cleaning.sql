-- 1. Remove duplicates
-- 2. Standardize the data (issues with spelling, white spaces at the beganning etc)
-- 3. NULL values or blank values
-- 4. Remove Any Columns OR Rows

-- Update the dates with a convertible format
Explanation

Add a New Column:
The new column new_date will store the converted date values.

Populate the New Column:
This query converts the text type date to varchar, and then to date. If the conversion is valid,
it populates the new_date column.

Drop and Rename:
Once the new column is populated with the correct date values, drop the old date
column and rename new_date to date.

*********************************************************************************************/

--Add a New Column:
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2 ADD new_date DATE;


--Populate the New Column:
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET new_date = TRY_CONVERT(DATE, TRY_CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), [date]), 101)
WHERE TRY_CONVERT(DATE, TRY_CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), [date]), 101) IS NOT NULL;


--Drop and Rename:
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2 DROP COLUMN [date];
EXEC sp_rename 'layoffs_staging2.new_date', 'date', 'COLUMN';



-- select the data:
SELECT * 
FROM [dbo].[layoffs_staging2];








-----Empty spaces:

--1. set empty space to null:

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;



-- we should set the blanks to nulls since those are typically easier to work with
UPDATE [dbo].[layoffs_staging2]
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';


-- now if we check those are all null
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;


-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

UPDATE t1
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
FROM layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2 ON t1.company = t2.company
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
  AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;




-- and if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;


SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE company = 'Bally%';




-- get rid of both column nulls(if total_laid_off AND percentage_laid_off both are null 
--                              then we can't trust that data therefore, we have to get tid of it)
SELECT *

/********************************************************************************************************
We conducted data cleaning on the layoffs_staging2 table to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, 
and ready for analysis. This process included creating a new table with appropriate data types, transferring
and formatting the data, handling date conversion issues, trimming text fields, replacing empty values with
NULL, and filling in missing industry values based on company matches. Data cleaning is crucial because it
eliminates errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies, which can significantly impact the quality and 
reliability of any analysis or insights derived from the data. Clean data ensures that analysis results 
are valid and trustworthy, leading to better decision-making.
